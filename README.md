# Understanding Einsum
A presentation explaining how Einsum could be understood and implemented.
This lays the blueprint for the algorithm which I implemented in [Thunder](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning-thunder).
Take a look at the [exact implementation](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning-thunder/blob/5f370f036706b6c31e4c627372cb46c3216920a5/thunder/torch/__init__.py#L3038).
I used these slides at a talk I gave to the team working on [NVFuser](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Fuser).
